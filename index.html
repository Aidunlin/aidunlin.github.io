		<h2>FRC Team 2471 - Mean Machine</h2>
		<p>
			I've been in
			<a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/">FIRST Robotics</a>
			for almost 10 years; it's been an important part of my life. Most of my interest in web development was formed
			through robotics, especially as a member of
			<a href="https://team2471.org/">Team Mean Machine</a>.
		</p>

		<details open>
			<summary><strong>Alumni & Mentor, 4 years, since 2021</strong></summary>
			<p>I am introducing student members to web development concepts through engaging projects.</p>
			<h3>MeanScout: Highly configurable peer-to-peer FRC scouting web app</h3>
			<p>
				We use
				<a href="https://github.com/TeamMeanMachine/MeanScout">MeanScout</a>
				to scout other teams during competitions; recording, analyzing, and visualizing data in an all-in-one app.
				Recent improvements include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Created co-op minigame that encourages scouts to analyze teams and strategize together</li>
				<li>Added interactive charts and visuals</li>
				<li>
					Incorporated QR codes and
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_code">fountain codes</a>
					to easily transfer any amount of data between devices without internet
				</li>
