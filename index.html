		<h2>FRC Team 2471 - Mean Machine</h2>
		<p>
			I've been in
			<a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/">FIRST Robotics</a> since
			<abbr title="FIRST Lego League">FLL</abbr> back in middle school. It's
			safe to say it's been an important part of my life. Most of my interest
			in web development was actually formed through robotics, especially as a
			member of <a href="https://team2471.org/">Team Mean Machine</a>.

			<p>
				I work with students to strengthen their web-dev skills through
				important and engaging projects.
			</p>
			<h3>Project management/tracking app</h3>
			<p>We are brainstorming a system that does a few things at once:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Improve communication between our two buildings: the shop and the
					STEMnasium
				</li>
				<li>Track projects - who is working on what, and where</li>
				<li>Track time spent</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Most importantly, this will be a very interesting project for newer
				students to jump on board with.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the meantime, we are using tools like Jira and GitHub Projects.
			</p>
			<h3>MeanScout: Robot performance data collection</h3>
			<p>
				We are maintaining the web app we use to scout other teams during
				competition. Recent improvements include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Sending data between devices using the Web Share API, as well as QR
					codes
				</li>
				<li>
					Creating weighted pick lists to rank teams on specific sets of data
				</li>
				<li>
					Fetching and storing team/match schedules from
					<a href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/about">The Blue Alliance</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
