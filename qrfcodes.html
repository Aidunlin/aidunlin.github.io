      <summary>Context: FRC and scouting</summary>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a>,
        or FRC, is an annual high-school level STEM sport. Each year, a new game with a unique theme challenges teams
        around the world to build hundred-pound robots. Competitions are comprised of qualifying matches and playoff
        matches. 6 teams split up into 2 alliances (red and blue) for every match.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams are chosen, semi-randomly, to fill in slots for every qualifying match. Notably, they don't get to choose
        their alliance or fellow teams. Once all the qualifying matches are over, the top 8 performing teams get to
        select other teams to form alliances for playoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scouting is the process of analyzing the performance of other teams. Teams scout in a variety of ways, for a
        variety of metrics. Official score reports usually have little data on individual robots. Regardless, the data
        gathered is used in alliance selection, as well as preparing strategies for upcoming qualifying matches.
      </p>
      <p>
        A scouting system is all the hardware and software used or maintained by a team (or multiple teams) for
        scouting.
      </p>
    </details>

    <p>
      How do you transfer scouting data?
    </p>
    <p>
      Each team has their own approach that fits with the rest of their scouting system: manual transfer from paper to
      spreadsheet; automatic transfer from Google Form to spreadsheet; mobile app to spreadsheet or database; mobile app
      to USB cable to laptop to spreadsheet; web app to local wired/bluetooth LAN server. So many ways!
    </p>
    <p>
      I've thought a lot about how the flexibility and compatibility of a scouting system can be restricted by the
      methods chosen to record and transfer data. Maybe it requires a specific combination of hardware and software.
      Maybe it requires internet access. Maybe it requires some external solution or third-party service that has its
      own limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would it be possible to build a scouting system that can avoid these problems?
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the biggest question I have attempted to answer with MeanScout, the scouting app used by Team Mean Machine
      (2471). Since its creation just over five years ago, I've experimented with quite a few different ways to set up,
      store, and transfer scouting data. I've slowly built it up to something that, for the most part, solves those
      problems for my team.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a web app, it can run on any device that supports a modern browser: desktops, laptops, tablets, phones. As an
      offline-able, cacheable, installable progressive web app, it can be used without internet access, and can act like
      a native app (without the pitfalls of developing and deploying native apps).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because MeanScout is a peer-to-peer (decentralized) scouting app, any device can act as your central repository of
      scouting data. Any device running MeanScout can import data, export data, analyze data, generate pick lists, and
      of course, record data. We choose which device to transfer all our scouting data to, even if that device is
      already used for scouting. We can also have as many devices acting as the "central repository" as we want, as long
      as we remember to update the data on those devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, because MeanScout supports generating and reading QR codes, data can be easily transferred between any
      camera-equipped devices running the app. If a device can't utilize QR codes, the app still supports device-level
      sharing and file importing/exporting.
    </p>
    <p>
      QR codes are super fast and super easy and super ubiquitous, but not that much data can be stored in one. We're
      talking a maximum of three kilobytes of raw binary data (or, less than three thousand ASCII characters) in one QR
      code. Oh, and scanning that big of a QR code can be difficult, especially for devices that use low-quality
      cameras, such as our cheap scouting tablets. Realistically, we have to limit the amount of data we can put in one
      QR code; otherwise, our scouting system would require devices with really good cameras. The smaller the QR code,
      the easier it will scan, but the less data it can hold. An optimization problem!
    </p>
    <p>
      We can circumvent this problem by splitting up the data into multiple QR codes. I've seen a few scouting apps that
      use a button to advance between them, and others that automatically display each one in consecutive order. That
      will work just fine for smaller data transfers, but if you skip a scan, you have to wait for it to loop back to
      the missed QR code (or manually do it yourself). If the data is large enough, it can quickly snowball into a
      hassle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a fascinating technique that deals with these annoyances. Enter: fountain codes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using randomness, a fundamental bitwise operation, and a bit of linear algebra, fountain code algorithms allow
      us to transfer any amount of data over endlessly generating QR codes, while providing an effective workaround for
      missed data.

    <h2>Info and Order: Special Meanings Unit</h2>

    <p>
      How do you communicate with someone? Out of our massive palette of methods of communication, it usually isn't with
      a singular instantaneous sound; you'd have to cram quite a bit of information into something so basic. However,
      there are examples of instant sounds we use. How about nonverbally screaming due to something unpleasant? Think of
      the worst food you've ever had an immediate, visceral, audible reaction to. That yelp of distaste is a singular
      data point that you can extend or repeat for as long as you want; eventually, someone else will realize that
      you're distressed. It wouldn't be very beneficial if your scream didn't last long enough for people to hear, so
      you usually scream enough so that people can (perhaps a second or two).
    </p>
    <p>
      But ultimately, other people don't need to listen to the entire length of your scream to receive the underlying
      message. In fact, it probably doesn't matter which part of your scream they actually comprehended. There's some
      point at which they've got it, and would like you to stop screaming about bad-tasting food now, thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at how we communicate through text and speech. We have to run through the entire message to both send
      and receive. With text, that is very asynchronous: it doesn't need to be read immediately after it's written. With
      speech, it can be asynchronous through an audio recording, but usually we listen to and comprehend speech almost
      as soon as it is spoken. For either case, the meaning and context aren't fully determined until after it ends:
      "Yes, this food is positively the worst tasting edible material I've ever had the pleasure of consuming, and my
      day is ruined."
    </p>
    <p>
      Complex information is transmitted through complex communication: unique, required, ordered segments assembled
      into meaning. One benefit is that it's really good at transmitting a lot of complex communication… assuming the
      receiver can handle it at the same rate that it comes in. Otherwise, it's common that the sender has to repeat
      certain chunks of the overall message by figuring out what parts the receiver(s) missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can relate limited communication (uh, screaming) to a water fountain: unordered, optional segments assembled at
      any point, in any way, into meaning. The benefit here, as I've pointed out, is that it doesn't matter what order
      you receive the parts of the message; you just need enough water to fill up an imaginary bucket, where a full
      bucket implies full comprehension. However, it does become much harder to relay complex information.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not impossible. Let's send complex information through a limited form of communication!
    </p>

    <h2>The Coveted Fountain of Codes</h2>

    <p>
      Take a complex message, and spit it up into equally sized chunks. Each chunk should be small enough to transmit in
      one go. Usually, the sender would put out each chunk in order: the first chunk, then the second chunk, and so on
      until the final chunk. If the receiver missed some chunks, the sender would have to start a second round of
      communication with the receiver to identify and re-send the missing chunks. Or, they could re-transmit the entire
      message if that can't be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      From here on out, assume that the receiver can't explain which chunks they missed, so the sender has to resend the
      entire message. After all, you can't go up and tell a water fountain which drops of water you missed. All you can
      do is fill up more water in your bucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we've gotten here is a continuous stream of information from the sender. After sending the last chunk, the
      sender starts right back up on the first chunk. Over and over again. That way, if the receiver misses a chunk,
      they can wait for the sender to go back around and resend the missed chunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the receiver has a hard time getting those chunks, it could take a long time for them to get the whole message.
      Especially for very long messages, where missing just one chunk means the receiver has to wait for the sender to
      get all the way back to where it missed the chunk. And that's only giving the receiver the chance to actually get
      that message; it could miss it again! It can't do much about it, as we've agreed that the receiver can't
      communicate back to the sender.
    </p>
    <p>
      In probability theory, this is called the coupon collector's problem: there's a selection of unique coupons; one
      item of a product line might have one of those coupons; collect all coupons to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hm, we could improve this particular receiver as much as possible to reduce its error rate, or we could just
      replace it with one that's much better. But nothing is perfect. Besides, as we inch closer to perfection, things
      usually tend to jump up in price. Instead, let's try changing the way those chunks are sent out, starting with the
      simplest modification: uniform, random selection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each chunk gets an equal chance to be sent out next. Yes, even if the chunk was just selected last time. This is
      the most extreme example of randomized selection. It also happens to be plagued with the coupon collector's
      problem: when you get down to just a few chunks left that need to be transmitted over, you're still using the same
      equal chance for each chunk. It becomes more and more likely to generate the chunks you don't need anymore!
      Combine this with the receiver's error rate, which could also be considered a form of the coupon collector's
      problem, and you can get a very poor overall transmission rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need a way to use randomness to acquire missed chunks without looping around the whole message, but also a way
      to reduce its impact on the transmission rate near the end. Is there a way we can somehow combine multiple parts
      of a message to be sent together in one chunk? Can we do so in a way that doesn't change the data size, while
      still being possible to revert it back into the individual parts? Enter the next piece of the puzzle: the XOR
      operator.
    </p>

    <h2>Carry-Free Addition</h2>

    <p>
      OR, AND, and XOR. Three simple logic gates that act as fundamental building blocks of computers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these gates has two inputs and one output. Each input can be on or off (1 or 0), and the same goes with
      the output. These gates compare their inputs to determine the output:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        OR: if at least one input is 1, the output is 1. (This or that or both)
      </li>
      <li>
        AND: if both inputs are 1, the output is 1. (This and that)
      </li>
      <li>
        XOR: if the inputs are different, the output is 1. (This or that, but not both)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      XOR is called "exclusive or" for a reason. Unlike OR, it won't output 1 if both inputs are 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding two binary numbers is done per column, using combinations of these three operations. XOR is used to
      determine the direct output of that column, while AND is used to determine whether a 1 should be carried out to
      the next column. There are actually two additions going on per column – one XOR for the two inputs, and another
      XOR for combining the result of that XOR and the previous column's carry – so an OR is used to combine the output
      of the two AND gates to output the carry for the next column to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if we tried combining parts of the message together using one of these logic gates? There is an important
      thing to keep in mind: however we combine those parts together, we need to be able to reverse the combination. Of
      course, without any information about the original parts, there would be no way to undo any of those operations.
      But that's okay! Because we're already sending out chunks of the message in random order, there's a half-decent
      chance that we've previously received one of the original chunks of the combined chunk. I'll get into more details
      about that process later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's say we can convert our message to a bunch of binary. Which one of those logic gates (or bitwise operations,
      now that we're talking binary) would be the best fit for our needs? Again, we need to be able to perfectly reverse
      the operation on the receiving end, assuming it has one of the inputs already.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does OR work? Going backwards, we either get a value of 0 or 1 on the receiving end. If the value is 0, then we
      can know for a fact that both inputs are 0, otherwise we'd get a 1. If the value is 1, and our known input is 0,
      then we know the last remaining input has to be 1. Pretty good so far, but problems arise when the known input is
      1 while the received value is also 1. We won't be able to know what the unknown input is, because in this case,
      the received value wouldn't be affected by it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Does AND work? Going backwards again, we either receive 0 or 1. If the value is 1, then we can know for a fact
      that both inputs have to be 1. If the value is 0, and our known input is 1, then we know the remaining input has
      to be 0 (otherwise, the output value would be 1). But if the value is 0, and the known input is 0, we can't figure
      out the last remaining input! A similar issue to OR.
    </p>
    <p>
      How about XOR? Going backwards, we either get 0 or 1 on the receiving end. If the value is 1, and our known input
      is 1, then we can conclude that the remaining input has to be 0. If the value is still 1, but our known input is
      0, then we can say the other input is 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the value is 0, and our known input is 1, then we know the other input is 0. And finally, if the value is 0,
      and our known input is 0, then we know the remaining input has to be a 1. Look at that, we've exhausted every
      possible combination, and there's no ambiguity!
    </p>
    <p>
      We now have a method to combine two chunks of a message together into one chunk, which also works backwards as
      long as we get one of the original chunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned binary addition earlier, couldn't that be used? Well, it can't reverse itself as easily as XOR. XOR
      can be done to each individual "column" of numbers in isolation (no carry info to affect other columns), and it
      doesn't need a modified algorithm to reverse the process; just use it again on the output value with an input to
      produce the other input.
    </p>

    <h2>Linequatiophobia</h2>

    <p>
      Remember how I said OR, AND, and XOR have two inputs? That's not the whole story. They can have any number of
      inputs. This means we can combine as many chunks as we want with XOR, and we can reverse this combination through
      repeatedly applying known inputs to the output via XOR.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's go through this process. Say a message is split into 8 chunks:
    </p>
    <pre><code>A B C D E F G H</code></pre>
    <p>
      And let's say we received a randomly combined chunk, as well as a randomly selected single chunk:
    </p>
    <pre><code>A AB</code></pre>
    <p>
      For future reference, every time we send a combined chunk, we'll include the name of each chunk combined. We can
      set up these equations, thanks to XOR's reversibility:
    </p>
    <pre><code>A ^ B = AB<br>AB ^ B = A<br>AB ^ A = B</code></pre>
    <p>
      This is just a system of linear equations! We already know what A is, as we've been given that single chunk. All
      we have to do is apply XOR to A and AB to get B:
    </p>
    <pre><code>A B</code></pre>
    <p>
      The AB chunk is redundant now that we have A and B.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's say we receive a combined chunk of 3 source chunks:
    </p>
    <pre><code>A B ABC</code></pre>
    <p>
      Here's some more linear equations:
    </p>
    <pre><code>A ^ B ^ C = ABC<br>A ^ ABC = BC<br>B ^ BC = C</code></pre>
    <p>
      First we XOR A and ABC:
    </p>
    <pre><code>A B BC</code></pre>
    <p>
      And then XOR B and BC:
    </p>
    <pre><code>A B C</code></pre>
    <p>
      Just like that, we have another piece of the message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any time we get a combined chunk during the receiving process, we apply any matching single chunks we've collected
      so far. And any time we get a single chunk, we apply it to any matching combined chunks collected so far. This
      action can then be propagated to other chunks if they can be XOR'd to get new information.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process ends once the number of singular chunks received is the same as the number the original message was
      split into. To ensure that the receiver knows the original count, we'll just include it at the beginning of each
      chunk, alongside the list of source chunk names. This forms the header data of the chunk, which is separate from
      the chunk's actual content. We don't apply XOR to the header data.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's the whole process for the receiving side. Now, let's round out with the last part of fountain codes: a
      better method of randomly selecting and combining message chunks on the sending side.
    </p>

    <h2>High Roller Math</h2>

    <p>
      Before, we tried to give each chunk an equal and random chance of being selected. While we're still going to do
      that, we now have another random selection to deal with: the number of chunks to be combined with XOR. The range
      is between 1 and n chunks (inclusive), where n is the total number of chunks that compose the message. Should we
      also give an equal chance for each value in that range? Or should we lean toward using certain values in that
      range?
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael Luby, the inventor of fountain codes, proposed a pair of probability distribution functions. These
      basically apply a value from a random number generator to a set of defined breakpoints within the possible range.
      For example, if you want to recreate a coin flip using a random number with a range from 0 to 1, you would check
      if the number is less or greater than 0.5. That's a breakpoint. If you want to rig it to favor one side of the
      "coin", you simply move around the breakpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luby's first probability function is called the "ideal soliton distribution". It's called "ideal" because it
      doesn't really account for transmission errors; it's not effective in practice. What does "soliton" mean? Good
      question. I haven't found a good definition that applies to statistics. Anyhow, the function is defined as:
    </p>
    <pre><code>p(1) = 1 / k<br>p(i) = 1 / (i * (i - 1)) // where i = 2,3,…,k</code></pre>
    <p>
      <code>i</code> is the number of chunks to combine. The function outputs the chance that the number is selected. To
      create breakpoints that we can iteratively check against our random value, we take each value and add it to the
      sum of the previous values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's say our <code>k</code> value is 8 (total chunks). The chance of selecting just one chunk is 1/8, or 12.5%.
      The chance of selecting two chunks is 1/2, or 50%. The chance of three chunks is 1/6, or 16.67%. This continues
      until selecting 8 chunks, which is 1/56, or 1.79%.
    </p>

    <p>
      I prefer to calculate each breakpoint and put them in an array, with indexes that match the corresponding chunk
      count. I iterate from index 1 (not 0), and pick the first index that points to a breakpoint greater than my random
      value. That index is now the number of chunks to be combined.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't use the ideal distribution though. Luby's second probability function is called the "robust soliton
      distribution". It takes several steps to construct, so I made a Desmos graph that breaks it down and has a visual
      comparison between the two soliton distributions.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to the ideal distribution, it increases the chances of selecting a single chunk and selecting a
      specifically large amount of chunks. It is fine-tuned with two parameters, one of which you base on the expected
      transfer success rate. If you want to get a sense for it, try nudging the <code>c</code> and <code>E</code>
      variables in that Desmos graph.

      Believe it or not, we have reached the end of our fountain code breakdown! With the probability distribution
      function and XOR, we can create efficiently encoded blocks to generate/display QR codes. With simple linear
      equations and XOR (again), we can decode those blocks as we receive/scan QR codes. Because we're treating complex
      data as a stream of quasi-homogeneous information, we can easily deal with unordered and missed chunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generating QR codes from encoded chunks is relatively straightforward. QR codes support a few data types: numbers,
      alphanumerics, bytes, and kanji. We just give the bytes of the encoded chunk to a QR code generator library/API
      (and don't forget the header data!). Of course, we'll want to repeatedly encode chunks, and keep generating QR
      codes over time. In MeanScout, I use a library that outputs to a canvas element, so I just keep generating newly
      encoded chunks and overwriting the canvas with the new QR code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scanning those QR codes is a similar process, besides capturing a device camera stream. Give each frame to your
      code reader library/API, and if it scans a new QR code, start attempting to decode it. I skip frames that have the
      same QR code by simply comparing the chunk header to the previous one. Once you've decoded each of the chunks,
      stop the code reader and stream capture, and send out your data to the rest of the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you could scan these QR codes with any QR code scanner, it would expect one singular, static QR code. And
      the data goes through multiple rounds of XOR while encoding, not to mention a compression step beforehand (at
      least for MeanScout's QRF codes), so you'd get useless bytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's probably a good idea to call these fountain code-powered QR codes something to differentiate them from
      regular old QR codes. So, I am hereby defining a quick response fountain code, or QRF code, as an endlessly
      generating set of QR codes powered by fountain code algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you know fountain codes, QRF codes, and a neat use case of QRF codes, you can tell your friends,
      teammates, mentors, parents, and random people on the street! If you like to move a lot of data around via QR
      codes, see if fountain codes could help with transfer rates. If your data is compressed enough or small enough in
      the first place, it probably won't provide much of a benefit.
    </p>

      If you want to check out MeanScout, you can find the link below. It can be used by any team (assuming it fits
      their needs), but if you are even remotely interested in developing your own scouting system/app, make it happen!
      Creating a scouting system involves quite a few technical areas adjacent to robotics, and reinventing the wheel is
      an incredible learning experience. It gives you the chance to learn from and build off of the fantastic work of
      other teams. It also gives you the chance to venture outside of the FRC world and discover creative, novel, niche,
      and weird solutions that no team has used, or even heard of.
